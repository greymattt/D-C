# Real-Time Voice Cloning Web Application (Flask Implementation)
This repository is an implementation of [Transfer Learning from Speaker Verification to
Multispeaker Text-To-Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04558.pdf) (SV2TTS) with a vocoder that works in real-time. Feel free to check [my thesis](https://matheo.uliege.be/handle/2268.2/6801) if you're curious or if you're looking for info I haven't documented. Mostly I would recommend giving a quick look to the figures beyond the introduction.

SV2TTS is a three-stage deep learning framework that allows to create a numerical representation of a voice from a few seconds of audio, and to use it to condition a text-to-speech model trained to generalize to new voices.

## News
**28/01/21**: Flask implementation of voice clone toolbox.

**11/01/21**: Result save support added. [(See This Repo)](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning-With-Save-Support)


**13/11/19**: I'm now working full time and I will not maintain this repo anymore. To anyone who reads this:
- **If you just want to clone your voice (and not someone else's):** I recommend our free plan on [Resemble.AI](https://www.resemble.ai/). Firstly because you will get a better voice quality and less prosody errors, and secondly because it will not require a complex setup like this repo does.
- **If this is not your case:** proceed with this repository, but be warned: not only is the environment a mess to setup, but you might end up being disappointed by the results. If you're planning to work on a serious project, my strong advice: find another TTS repo. Go [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/issues/364) for more info.

**20/08/19:** I'm working on [resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer), an independent package for the voice encoder. You can use your trained encoder models from this repo with it.

**06/07/19:** Need to run within a docker container on a remote server? See [here](https://sean.lane.sh/posts/2019/07/Running-the-Real-Time-Voice-Cloning-project-in-Docker/).

**25/06/19:** Experimental support for low-memory GPUs (~2gb) added for the synthesizer. Pass `--low_mem` to `demo_cli.py` or `demo_toolbox.py` to enable it. It adds a big overhead, so it's not recommended if you have enough VRAM.


## Setup

### 1. Install Requirements

**Python 3.6 or 3.7** is needed to run the toolbox.

* Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (>=1.0.1).
* Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#get-packages).
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the remaining necessary packages.
* Also install Flask with pip using command `pip install Flask`
### 2. Download Pretrained Models
Download the latest [here](https://github.com/CorentinJ/Real-Time-Voice-Cloning/wiki/Pretrained-models).

### 3. Run The Server
Run the server by following given command.

`python server.py`

You will see a window as shown below. Some text. 

[![Run The Server](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Voice-Clone-Application-Flask-Web-App/blob/main/images/Run%20Server.jpg)](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Voice-Clone-Application-Flask-Web-App/blob/main/images/Run%20Server.jpg)

### 4. Run in Browser
Copy the given url and paste in browser. I recommend you to please use incognito / guest versions of browsers as browsers saves caches and you may hear old audios after uploading and while listening cloned voices. (Work is needed to be done on not saving caches in server.py code).

[![Browser Window Preview](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Voice-Clone-Application-Flask-Web-App/blob/main/images/Open%20In%20Browser.jpg)](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Voice-Clone-Application-Flask-Web-App/blob/main/images/Open%20In%20Browser.jpg)

### 5. Browse Audio
Browse the audio mp3 or wav file, for which you want to create an utterance.
Note: Audios will be overwrited if they have same names.
Note: Audios will uploaded in static folder.

### 6. Type Text
Type the text for which you want to create audio..


### 7. Click Upload
Click on Upload Button. Example Uploads are shown below
[![Example Upload](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Voice-Clone-Application-Flask-Web-App/blob/main/images/Example%20of%20Upload.jpg)](https://github.com/Sba-Stuff/Voice-Clone-Application-Flask-Web-App/blob/main/images/Example%20of%20Upload.jpg)


### 8. Listen The Difference.
Listen The Difference Between Two Audios Enjoy It.
Generated Output is saved in static folder named "output.wav". This file is overwrited with every new experiment. You can add some random numbers or date time to make it unique in file "server.py" at line 113 `fpath = "static/output.wav"`. (Example: `fpath = "static/output"+somerandomstuff+".wav"`). Output preview is shown below.

### 9. Enjoy. Note
Do Not Abuse this code. I modified this code for educational purposes, polishing my skills over python and presenting information in unique ways.
Note: Never click upload button without browse audio selection and text. It will give unexpected outputs.

You can see the debug information in console where server is running for letting know what is happening at background as shown below;
